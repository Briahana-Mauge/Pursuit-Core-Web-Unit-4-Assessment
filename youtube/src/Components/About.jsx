        <p>This youtube clone was poorly built by Briahana as part of her unit 4 assessment.</p>
         <p>Technologies used for this project include Youtube's API, React, CSS and several npm packages, like 'react-youtube'. </p>
        <p> On the home page, you can search for video and select your pick from the first 8 choices from your search. </p>
        <p>Clicking on the video takes you to the video's page where you can watch and hopefully one day can leave comments. </p>
